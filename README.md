Project was imported and originally made for CS 3345 (Data Structures and Introduction to Algorithmic Analysis) with Professor Kamran Khan.
Please check documentation, project implementation is extremely confusing in hindsight.

Thoughts: The hardest project I've done in the first three semesters of my undergraduate career, aside from a MIPS assembly project. Being forced to use linked lists, trying
to use two classes defined in each other for style points, struggling hard, then finally being told linked lists were not a requirement was the most frustrating thing about this
project. The class was also not taught a thing about iterative backtracking and even Google didn't have a concrete answer on what it was, leaving me to figure it out. I knew the
general concept of it but trying to 'derive' the process from scratch was a learning process. Dijkstra's algorithm itself was easy since I was already familiar with it but since
I had to use an adjacency list of linked lists instead of a graph with nodes, the whole thing is inefficient. Instead of having to do a linear search twice to find a certain
adjacent vertex, an overall structure of a map mapping vertices to a set of adjacent vertices would significantly decrease lookup time. I do remember having points taken off for
failure to consider cases such as vertices with negative weight and missing/incomplete input data, but at that point I was completely over it. Overall, while I would've preferred
clearer instructions, I enjoyed the learning experience.
